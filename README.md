# ID3 Decision Tree

An implementation of the [ID3 Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm) for the creation of decision trees via maximizing information gain. Intended for data with any number of features with only a single label (which can be multi-class). Binary splitting was employed to account for continuous data. A report summarizing the results and methodology was used as well.
